# About Me

I’m a **fintech and operations leader** who builds tools to make complex workflows simpler.

I focus on:

- 💳 Financial operations – reconciliations, custody, IRAs, payments  
- 📊 Data & reporting – turning messy exports into reliable insights  
- ⚙️ Automation – building internal tools that reduce manual work  
- 🤖 AI-assisted development – using ChatGPT as a pair programmer to move faster

This site is my **Build Lab** – a place to show projects like:

- `finops-platform` – a modular finops lab
- `finops-recon` – a reconciliation engine for banks, custodians, and ledgers
- `local-transcriber` – an offline audio/video transcription app
