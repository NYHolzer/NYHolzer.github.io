# 👋 Hi, I’m Nissan

I’m a **fintech & operations leader** who builds practical tools with **code + AI** —  
everything from reconciliation engines to one-off utilities that remove friction from real workflows.

This is my **Build Lab** — a curated collection of projects and experiments built using:

- 🐍 Python, FastAPI, SQL, Pandas  
- 📊 Data & reconciliations across banks, custodians, and internal ledgers  
- 🤖 ChatGPT as a pair programmer and design partner  
- 🕍 Publishing & learning tools for Torah and structured text  

👉 Start with **[Projects](./projects/)** to see the highlights.  
👉 Or explore **[Build Logs](./build-logs/)** to see *how* I think and build.
