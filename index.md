## 👋 Hi, I’m Nissan

I build tools that make **financial operations** and **day-to-day work** less painful:

- 🧮 Reconciliation engines for banks, custodians, and internal ledgers  
- ⚙️ Internal tools that clean data and reduce manual busywork  
- 🎙️ Desktop apps for offline transcription and content creation  

This site is my **Build Lab** – a curated place to show what I’m building and how I think about problems.

## 🚀 Flagship Projects

> A few projects that best represent how I blend fintech ops, data, and engineering.

### ⚙️ FinOps Platform – Analyst Module

A public fintech “lab” where I experiment with:

- SEC/EDGAR data ingestion  
- Balance sheet parsing with Pandas  
- Metrics & HTML report generation  

👉 [Build log](/2025/10/01/finops-platform-build-log.html)  
👉 Code: <https://github.com/NYHolzer/finops-platform>

---

### 🧮 FinOps Recon – Reconciliation Engine

A Python-based recon engine for comparing:

- bank exports  
- custodian data  
- internal ledgers  

with schema-aware ingestion and exception-driven outputs.

👉 [Build log](/2025/10/05/finops-recon-build-log.html)

### 🎙️ Local Transcriber – Offline Audio & Video Transcription

A desktop app (Python + PySide6 + faster-whisper) that:

- transcribes audio & video **fully offline**  
- lets me edit segments inline  
- exports clean `.txt` and `.srt` files  

👉 [Build log](/2025/12/08/local-transcriber-build-log.html)  
👉 Code: <https://github.com/NYHolzer/local-transcriber>

## 📚 Build Logs – How I Work

I write **build logs** to document real milestones – not every commit, but the decisions that matter:

- why I built a tool  
- how the architecture evolved  
- what I learned from shipping it  

👉 Browse all logs here: **[Build Logs](/build-logs/)**

_(The latest build logs also appear in the **Posts** list below.)_
