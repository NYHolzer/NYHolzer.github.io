# 🛠️ Projects

A curated selection of the tools, platforms, and experiments I’ve built — blending **fintech operations**, **data automation**, and **AI-assisted development**.

These are real, evolving projects that reflect how I think, how I build, and how I approach solving operational problems with code.

## 🧮 FinOps Recon (Private)

**What it is**  
A reconciliation engine for comparing transactions across **banks**, **custodians**, and **internal ledgers**. Designed to surface breaks, mismatches, and exceptions automatically.

**Highlights**
- Schema + data model for multi-source transaction ingestion  
- Pandas-powered matching logic  
- API endpoints for running recon jobs (FastAPI-style design)  
- Built specifically for real fintech ops workflows  
- Focus on auditability, reliability, and simple deployment  

**Why it matters**  
Reconciliations are the beating heart of fintech operations.  
This project demonstrates experience with:

- Financial data pipelines  
- Break detection logic  
- Ledger consistency issues  
- Exception workflows  
- Ops automation  

**Tech**  
Python · Pandas · FastAPI (conceptual) · SQLite  

**Links**  
- Repo: Private (available upon request)  
- Build Log: *(Coming soon)*

## ⚙️ FinOps Platform (Public)
**Repo:** https://github.com/NYHolzer/finops-platform

A **public fintech automation lab** where I’m building modular components for:

- AI-driven financial operations  
- Data enrichment  
- Trade analysis  
- Workflow automation  
- Reconciliation extension modules  

**Highlights**
- Built in public  
- Experiments with AI analysts & automation flows  
- Modular, extensible Python architecture  
- Real operator thinking translated into code  
- Shows how I merge domain expertise with engineering  

**Why it matters**  
This project signals that I don’t just code —  
I build tools **for real problems that operators face**.

**Tech**  
Python · Modular architecture · AI integration patterns

## 🕍 Torah Layout Studio (Public)
**Repo:** https://github.com/NYHolzer/torah-layout-studio

A TypeScript/React experiment exploring how to **structure, render, and typeset Torah text**, commentaries, and translations.

Inspired by challenges in producing:

- Sefarim  
- Divrei Torah  
- Daf Yomi handouts  
- Learning sheets  
- The Yeshuas Nissan Haggadah  

**Highlights**
- Rich-text + structured-text thinking  
- Layout engine prototypes  
- UI concepts for visualizing aligned Hebrew + English  
- React component architecture  
- A genuinely unique niche project  
- Demonstrates both creativity and engineering  

**Why it matters**  
Shows ability to think beyond fintech:  
tooling, design, UX, structured content modeling.

**Tech**  
TypeScript · React

## ⚡ Additional Experiments & Utilities

These smaller tools reflect how I rapidly build helpful utilities during my work:

### 🎙️ Local Audio Transcriber
A script/app that converts learned audio (shiurim, divrei Torah, etc.) into usable text via local transcription.

- Shows practical coding  
- Workflow automation  
- Supports real creative output  
- Python-based tool  

*(Repo coming soon — built locally)*

### 📰 PDF / Newspaper Splitter Tool
Utility for splitting or extracting sections from large PDFs (e.g., historical documents from the shechita legislation archive).

- Python + PDF processing  
- Solves real research workflow pain  

*(Repo coming soon — built locally)*

### 📊 CSV Cleanup & Data Helpers
Small Python utilities for:

- Standardizing column names  
- Normalizing dates + amounts  
- Cleaning exports from banks, CRMs, or custodians  

*(Often used inside finops tooling; grouped here)*

# 🧭 Build Philosophy

Across these projects, my goals are consistent:

- **Reduce operational friction**  
- **Automate repetitive workflows**  
- **Create clarity in messy data**  
- **Use AI as a force multiplier, not a replacement**  
- **Ship fast, iterate intentionally**
